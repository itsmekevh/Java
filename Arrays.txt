double [] temperatures = new double [7];

[] = array.

the first element of the array is always at index [0]

temperatures[0] = 27.2;

the last index is always the number of items - 1 

temperature sub 0 = temperature[0] 

- example where it is clunky, better version shown later -
double sum = 0.0;
int index = 0;
sum = sum + temperature[index];
index++;

sum = sum + temperature[index];
index++;

you can assign things in curly braces 

double [] temperatures = {27.2, 22.3, ..... }

temperature.length can use this variable for the size of the array

ex. for (int index = 0; index < temperature.length; index++){
		sum = sum + temperatures[index];
		}
		
	99% of the time you will use a for loop to iterate through an array
		

dot notation read right to left

temperature.length = length of the array temperature.
remember the total elements are the number of elements - 1

FOREACH LOOP

can be used to be a bit more compact

read this as for each item in the temperatures list
for (double item: temperatures) {
	sum = sum + item
}
