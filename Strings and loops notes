Part 1 phone word
input ---> result
CARS-1-AA ---> on phone would be = 2277122
GREAT DEALS ---> 4732833257 ---> 4732833

the input length doesn't matter, the output length does matter

C-A-T-S! ---> 2287 ---> too short for a phone word. (result < 7 digits long)

result = ""; // start with empty string
Read in phone word
convert it to uppercase (for all lower case) for our convenience
for each character in the phone word {
	if its a digit add it to the result
	otherwise if it is a letter{
		figure out which numeral the letter corresponds to
		add that numeral to the end of the result
		} otherwise {
				do nothing at all --- ignore it  (not a letter or digit)
		}
	}
}

if the length of result >= 7 {
	print the first 7 digits
} else {
	its an error
	}
	
	
	
Part 2: 

10, 3, 7

double sum 0
double sumsq 0

10 ---> sum becomes 10, sumsq = 100
3 ---> sum becomes 13, sumsq = 100 + 9 = 109
7 ---> sum becomes 20, sumsq = 109 + ( 7 * 7 ) = 158
